## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design
*Due Friday, 11/15, by the **start of class**.*

**Project Title**: Rock, Paper, Lizard, Spock, Scissors

**Purpose**: The program will enable users to play Rock,Paper,Lizard,Spock, and Scissors
️**Sources**: A07-Rock, Paper, Scissor

**Completed CRC card for the class you will implement**:
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to
  use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card
  as an image and including the image(s) in the README. You can do this
  by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - and replace it with your own.

### ❗User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. 
Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button. 

### ❗Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. 
Use this section to create a bullet list of all known errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. 
Bugs you acknowledge here won't be penalized. 
Bugs found that aren't acknowledged here will be penalized!

### ❗Reflection
In 3 - 4 well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
